# **'School - Super Data Structure' - Personal Project.**

### In this project, I designed a data structure with the following capabilities:

## Basic methods:
- Import data from files.
- Add new student/worker - logarithmic complexity.
- Remove student/worker - logarithmic complexity. 
- Print details of all students (sorted alphabetically) - linear complexity.
- Print details of all workers (sorted alphabetically) - linear complexity.
- Find if student/worker exists by his name - constant time in worst case - SOON.
- Get student/worker data by his name - logarithmic complexity.

## Statistical methods:
**All of the following methods operate in time complexity of O(1).**
- Get the worker with the highest salary.
- Get the student with the highest GPA.
- Get average salary.
- Get average GPA.
- Get median salary.
- Get median GPA.

** space complexity O( n + m ).
