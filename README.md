## **'School - Super Data Structure' - Personal Project.**

### In this project, I designed a data structure with the following capabilities:

### Basic methods:
| Description | Time Complexity |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Import data from files | O(n) |
| Remove student/worker | O(log(n)) |
| Add new student/worker | O(log(n)) |
| Search student/worker | O(1) worst case! |
| Get vector of workers by type (RTTI) | O(n) |
| Print details of all workers/students (sorted alphabetically) | O(n) |
| Get vector of students sorted according to the user's choice (default: by GPA) | O(n) |

### Statistical methods:
| Description | Time Complexity |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Get median GPA | O(1) |
| Get median salary | O(1) |
| Get average GPA | O(1) |
| Get average salary | O(1) |
| Get the student with the highest GPA | O(1) |
| Get the worker with the highest salary | O(1) |
| Get the workers that meet a certain condition (default: outstanding) | O(n) |
| Get the students that meet a certain condition (default: outstanding) | O(n) |

### Static methods:
| Description | Time Complexity |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Set base salary for workers | O(1) |
| Set bonus salary for tutors | O(1) |

** space complexity O(n + m).
