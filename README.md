# **'School - Super Data Structure' - Personal Project.**

#### In this project, I designed a data structure with the following capabilities:

### Basic methods:
| Description | Time Complexity |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Import data from files | linear |
| Remove student/worker | logarithmic |
| Add new student/worker | logarithmic |
| Search student/worker | constant time (worst case!) |
| Get vector of workers by type (RTTI) | linear |
| Print details of all workers/students (sorted alphabetically) | linear |
| Get vector of students sorted according to the user's choice (default: by GPA) | linear |

## Statistical methods:
| Description | Time Complexity |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Get median GPA | constant time |
| Get median salary | constant time |
| Get average GPA | constant time |
| Get average salary | constant time |
| Get the student with the highest GPA | constant time |
| Get the worker with the highest salary | constant time |
| Get the workers that meet a certain condition (default: outstanding) | linear complexity |
| Get the students that meet a certain condition (default: outstanding) | linear complexity |

## Static methods:
| Description | Time Complexity |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Set base salary for workers | constant time |
| Set bonus salary for tutors | constant time |

** space complexity O(n + m).
