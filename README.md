# **'School - Super Data Structure' - Personal Project.**

### In this project, I designed a data structure with the following capabilities:

## Basic methods:
- Import data from files.
- Remove student/worker - logarithmic complexity.
- Add new student/worker - logarithmic complexity.
- Search student/worker - constant time (worst case!).
- Get vector of workers by type (RTTI) - linear complexity.
- Print details of all workers/students (sorted alphabetically) - linear complexity.

## Statistical methods:
- Get the workers that meet a certain condition (default: Outstanding) - linear complexity.
- Get the students that meet a certain condition (default: Outstanding) - linear complexity.

**All of the following methods operate in time complexity of O(1).**
- Get the worker with the highest salary.
- Get the student with the highest GPA.
- Get average salary.
- Get average GPA.
- Get median salary.
- Get median GPA.

** space complexity O(n + m).
